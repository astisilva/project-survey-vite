# Survey Project

- This project is a survey application built using React. The purpose of the app is to collect user responses. I used React's useState hook to handle and update the app's state as needed.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

- For this project I started by applying what I learned in my lessons. When I faced challenges or needed help, I searched for it online and asked ChatGPT for clarification. This approach helped me build a strong foundation and overcome any difficulties during the project.
